# Procedural Maze Add-on

This repository contains a simple Battle for Wesnoth add-on that generates a random 50x50 maze for a cooperative multiplayer scenario.

## Installation
1. Copy the `new_50x50` directory into your Wesnoth user data `add-ons` folder. On Linux this is typically `~/.local/share/wesnoth/1.16/data/add-ons/`.
2. Launch Wesnoth and enable the "Procedural Maze Co-op" add-on.

## Running
Create a new multiplayer game and select the "Procedural Maze Co-op" scenario. A maze will be generated automatically when the map loads.
