# Procedural Maze Co-op Addon

This add-on creates a maze procedurally using the Lua script
`generate_maze.lua`. The script always generates a 50Ã—50 map when the
scenario starts. The `map_data` in `procedural_maze.cfg` is only a placeholder
so that the scenario file remains valid; it will be replaced by the generated
maze at run time.
